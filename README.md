# Cryptool

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/cryptool/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/cryptool)

*Cryptography for humans*

Cryptool wants to help you to protect the information that matter most to you. We don't hide anything that's going on under the hood, we show the algorithms and data input/output as it is.

This is a non-profit open source solution and we are not interested in your data. Anyway, we do not ask you to trust, we ask you to **block** the Internet access, **review** the code, or even **build** the app yourself.
